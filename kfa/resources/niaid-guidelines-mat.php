<p>An  estimated 5% of children age 5 years and younger have food allergies, reports  the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases (<acronym title="National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases">NIAID</acronym>)<strong style="color:#1F8499;">*</strong>. In an effort to address this rising public health  problem, NIAID worked with the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp;  Immunology and other organizations to create food allergy guidelines. </p>
<p>The <em><a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/docs/FAguidelinesPatient.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview(\'/downloads/NIAIDguidelines');">Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food  Allergy in the United States</a></em> were released in December 2010  and published as a supplement to the<em> Journal of Allergy and Clinical  Immunology</em>. A committee of 34 professional medical organizations, groups  and agencies helped to oversee its development. </p>
<p>Consisting  of 43 clinical recommendations, the guidelines are intended to aid physicians in diagnosing and managing patients  with food allergies. Additionally, they help to inform parents about advised diagnostic tests, treatment and prevention. </p>
Below, members of <a href="http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/mat.html" target="_blank">KFA's medical advisory team</a> provide insight into which  recommendations they feel parents should be made aware of and why. <br />
<br />
<br />
<h2 style="color:#1F8499; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color:#B1DFF9; padding:2px; line-height:1.1">Guideline #7: The Expert Panel (EP) recommends specific IgE (sIgE) tests for identifying foods that potentially provoke IgE-mediated food-induced allergic reactions, but alone these tests are not diagnostic of Food Allergy.
</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Testing for specific IgE to foods, through either  skin or serum testing, is very helpful in diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergic  reactions, but these tests should never take the place of a good history or  possibly a food challenge,&rdquo; said Todd D. Green, MD, assistant professor of  pediatrics in the Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy &amp; Immunology at  Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. </p>
<p>In general, a bigger skin test size or higher level  of specific IgE in serum means that allergy is more likely, but the distinction  between sensitization (positive skin test, or detectable specific IgE in serum)  and clinical allergy (development of specific signs and symptoms of a reaction  that develop after exposure) is very important to recognize. <strong style="color:#1F8499;">It is  well-established that individuals may be sensitized, and therefore test  &quot;positive,&quot; but may not be clinically allergic.</strong> </p>
<p>This guideline also highlights the fact that there  are differences between the systems used to measure specific IgE, so that  values may differ depending on the system used, Dr. Green explained. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Generally, if someone is tolerating a food, it is  not necessary to perform any allergy testing to that food. Testing that is not  indicated may lead to adverse consequences, such as unwarranted dietary  changes, heightened anxiety and possibly adverse nutritional effects,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<br />
<h2 style="color:#1F8499; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color:#B1DFF9; padding:2px; line-height:1.1">Guideline #30: The EP recommends that patients with Food Allergy and their caregivers be provided with information on food allergen avoidance and emergency management that is age and culturally appropriate.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;While it may seem  like a simple thing, patients and families need to know that there is  information out there for them and for someone who may care for their  child. This guideline is really about being proactive in your management  of food allergies—both food avoidance and the management of an emergency,&rdquo;  noted David  W. Hauswirth, MD, FAAAAI, FACAAI, clinical assistant professor of Internal  Medicine and Pediatrics, Allergy and Immunology at The Ohio State University  Medical Center in Nationwide Children's Hospital. </p>
<p>Patients and  families need to work with their doctors to get the information they need; for  each patient this will be different, Dr. Hauswirth explained. As a patient, one  must make sure he understands the  information and that it applies to the foods he eats and how he lives  his life. If the foods that are a natural part of one’s diet are not  discussed, inquire specifically about those foods, whether they are safe and  how to make them safe. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Parents should also  work with the tools they have available to them to introduce the  concept of food avoidance to their child in a safe, comfortable,  age-appropriate way,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Emergency  management of food allergies is a difficult item to teach as each situation and  person is different. However, families need to insist on knowing what to  do and asking the right questions so that the doctor or nurse educating them  can tailor the learning to their needs. ;More importantly, families need to  know how to teach other caregivers about avoidance and treating a  reaction. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This may mean  coming up with a strategy to teach a younger babysitter about snacks or food in  your home. It may mean training a daycare provider what your child does and  doesn't eat,&rdquo; said Dr. Hauswirth. &ldquo;At the same time, you will need  to teach these people how to determine when your child is having a  reaction and what to do.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The key to this, which  is written into this guideline statement, is that the information is easy for  them to understand, age-appropriate and culturally sensitive. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The best teaching  in the world will not overcome cultural or comprehension barriers,&rdquo; Dr.  Hauswirth commented. </p>
<p>Attention to good  teaching will give parents peace of mind when they have to leave their child  with someone else, as well as a better, safer situation for your child. </p>

<h2 style="color:#1F8499; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color:#B1DFF9; padding:2px; line-height:1.1">Guideline #36 - The EP does not recommend restricting maternal diet during pregnancy or lactation as a strategy for preventing the development or clinical course of Food Allergy.</h2>
<p>This particular  point has been the center of debate for many years. At the heart of the  discussion is the desire for parents to decrease the chance that their child  will develop food allergies. Older advice suggested avoiding highly allergenic  foods during pregnancy and when breastfeeding as a strategy to decrease the  risk of food allergies. Unfortunately, this strategy has not been proven effective  at reducing food allergies. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The best advice at  this time is to eat a balanced, healthy diet that provides all the nutrition  necessary for a pregnant mother and a growing infant,&rdquo; said Dr. Hauswirth. </p>
<p>The authors of the  guidelines looked at the available research on this topic and concluded that  the best studies and information supported an unrestricted diet. Proper  nutrition is of the utmost importance here. </p>
<p>Dr. Hauswirth noted  that the follow-up to this is the recommendation that (unless there is a  medical reason not to) mothers breastfeed their children exclusively for the  first four to six months. In this section of the guidelines, the authors  focus on the evidence and infant nutrition. </p>

<strong style="color:#1F8499;">*</strong>The prevalence of food allergy quoted by NIAID was based on a 2007 study by the Centers for Disease Control. In 2011, <em>Pediatrics</em> published a study that found <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/06/16/peds.2011-0204.abstract" target="_blank">food allergy affects 8% of children</a> in the United States.
